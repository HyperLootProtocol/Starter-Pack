You've come to my Github, a place for all things me! And the [DAO](https://github.com/HyperLootProtocol/Starter-Pack/wiki/Team) that works with me. Together, we are building [Hyperloot](https://github.com/HyperLootProtocol/Hyperloot-Documentation/blob/master/product/ONEPAGER.md). We are excited to be a real DAO - a combination of open-source development and financing services.

DAO posesses a set of tools: technology , financial,and organiztional.
Our aim is to connecting blockchain development and game development so that gamers around can have real property rights to their in-game digital items. It will make trading and exchanging items possible.
