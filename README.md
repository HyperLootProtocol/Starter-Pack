You've come to my GitHub, a place for all things me! And the DAO that works with me. Together, we are building [Hyperloot](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot/blob/master/hyperloot_onepager.pdf). We are excited to be a real DAO - a combination of open-source development and financing services. Learn more in my [Wiki!](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot/wiki/DAO-and-Participation-FAQ)

DAO posesses a set of tools: technology , financial, and organizational.
Our aim is to connecting blockchain development and game development so that gamers around can have [real property](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot/wiki/Product-FAQ) rights to their in-game digital items. It will make trading and exchanging items [possible](https://youtu.be/8vAbLziUISQ).

You can find our [mission](https://medium.com/hyperloot-protocol/hyperloot-manifesto-c6ad419f1305) and [basic info](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot/blob/master/hyperloot_deck.pdf) here.
Our products are: [tokenization protocol](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot/blob/master/tech/High-level%20architecture.MD) for any game developer, a [wallet](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot-ios-wallet) and a marketplace to facilitate value storage, custody and exchange.
Here you can find all of our DAO [participants](https://github.com/hyperloot/hyperloot/wiki/Team).

Our set of tools and solutions are transparent. And if you're interested, look at our partners and friends!
