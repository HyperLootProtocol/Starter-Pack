# What’s Hyperloot?

A protocol for safe and quick transfer of in-game items into crypto-assets making them tradable (like bitcoin).  
Our aim is to lower the entry barrier and let all of the 2,6 billion gaming community trade on a 150 trillion crypto market. 

# Exactly what is Hyperloot good for?

* Every game is built around a closed economy system. This creates multiple profit pools with a one-sided interaction limiting overall capitalization. 
* Users do not own in-game items even if they pay money for them. A game can be closed by a third party with complete loss of accounts and items. All while people spend hundreds of millions of dollars in games. 
* There’s no open marketplace for games and the ones existing are promoting internal games and items. 
* We’re about to fix that creating a place to trade all items, with understandable pricing rules and cross-game value.  

# So how does it work?

A developer embeds Hyperloot SDK and wallet into the game. It allows to emit in-game items as Ethereum network tokens. Doing so, in turn, allows for trade and storage on any marketplace or exchange as well as within the game. 

# Hyperloot features

* Easy-to-use - open source wallet, Unity and Unreal SDK . Developers can easily join the platform. 
* Free trade - p2p trading with no commision and an open market with understandable rules. 
* Crowd Development – the project is developed by a DAO, a team of developers from different backgrounds and game teams.
* Supervising – Hyperloot offers a matchmaking engine for low-liquid goods and market supporting features. 
* Co-owning games – users can support and complete development on their favourite games, earning royalties in the process. They can invest in certain items, guilds or real estate and exchange them with profit. 
* Decentralized exchange -  all of the in-game items become assets and can be sold or bought at ane Ethereum-based exchange.

# Go-to-market

Hyperloot allows for price discovery and development for different sets of digital items. Our business model is built around an open platform where people can trade with a low comission. Developers, in turn, can create digital assets and raise their product capitalization along with the trade frequency, interacting with their community.
