[size=24pt][b]What is the project about?[/b][/size]

[size=15pt]Gamers spend thousands of dollars purchasing in-game items that remain as private property rights of a game publisher.  We call it fake rights.  Absence of blockchain-based property rights is the biggest barrier in Esports betting adoption.[/size]

[size=15pt]HyperLoot Protocol helps game developers to monetize e-games based on esports betting and free digital assets exchange. HyperLoot  MasterNode network charges zero transaction fees on any digital items exchange which uses native HLT token for clearing.[/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/jQsY5Iw.png[/img]

[size=24pt][b]Why this is important?[/b][/size]

[size=15pt]Private property rights is fundamental part of your freedom and autonomy.  Absence of private property for in-game assets, limits innovation and development in the gaming and crypto space.[/size]
